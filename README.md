# CSC-375-Project-3

## Project 3 for Doug Lea's Fall 2020 Parallel Computing Class

### Project Background:

Write a one- or two- player game/puzzle using parallel move evaluation. Choose a game/puzzle with a compact representation among those illustrated at [Puzzle Collection pages](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/puzzles/) (or others, upon approval), and for which full rules are available; for example, more details for "peg solitaire" . The user interface is up to you, so long as it accurately depicts current game state. If a two-player puzzle, ensure that it can be run with both sides chosen by a move evaluator. The move evaluator should have adjustable depth and parallelism. Test and demonstrate runs with varying numbers of cores.
